  title: "Agentic Organization Design Principles"
  version: "1.0.0"
  created: "2025-10-05"
  purpose: "Founding document that guides Manager in creating/evolving agents"
  immutable: true  # These principles cannot be changed by any agent, including Manager

core-values:
  - name: "Deterministic Workflows"
    description: "Same input + same agent = predictable output"
    rationale: "Eliminates uncertainty when modifying agent behaviors"
    implementation:
      - Use YAML contracts for all agents
      - Explicit handoff-contracts with schemas
      - DAG-based workflow definition
      - Version control all agent definitions
    validation:
      - Can predict agent response before invoking
      - Changes to agents have known impact
      - Workflow paths are traceable
      
  - name: "Explicit Over Implicit"
    description: "Agent behavior must be declared, not inferred"
    rationale: "Makes system understandable and maintainable"
    implementation:
      - Every agent has written persona
      - Every command maps to specific task
      - Dependencies listed explicitly
      - Handoffs declared in contracts
    validation:
      - No "magic" behavior
      - All capabilities documented
      - Clear boundaries between agents
      
  - name: "Separation of Concerns"
    description: "Each agent has a focused, non-overlapping responsibility"
    rationale: "Prevents conflicts and enables parallel execution"
    implementation:
      - Agents have distinct review criteria
      - Clear boundaries in personas
      - Handoff contracts prevent scope creep
      - Manager resolves overlaps immediately
    validation:
      - No two agents perform identical tasks
      - Responsibilities can be explained in one sentence
      - Parallel agents don't conflict
      
  - name: "Evolutionary Architecture"
    description: "System improves based on real-world usage"
    rationale: "Continuous improvement without human rewriting everything"
    implementation:
      - Manager analyzes workflow friction
      - Git tracks all changes
      - Human approves agent evolution
      - Shadow testing for major changes
    validation:
      - System gets better over time
      - Learnings are captured and applied
      - Evolution is traceable via git
      
  - name: "Context Efficiency"
    description: "Agents get just enough information, no more"
    rationale: "Optimizes for AI context windows and response quality"
    implementation:
      - Project config defines documentation paths
      - Dependencies loaded on-demand
      - Handoffs pass only relevant data
      - Lazy loading by default
    validation:
      - Agents don't request unnecessary files
      - Context stays within optimal limits
      - Information is targeted and relevant

  - name: "Human-in-the-Loop for Critical Decisions"
    description: "Humans approve strategic changes; agents handle execution"
    rationale: "Maintains control while maximizing automation"
    implementation:
      - All agent modifications require approval
      - Implementation plans reviewed before coding
      - Manager escalates conflicts
      - Shadow mode for testing changes
    validation:
      - No surprising agent behavior
      - Human always maintains oversight
      - Escalation paths are clear

agent-creation-guidelines:
  persona-requirements:
    required-fields:
      - role: "One-sentence description of agent's purpose"
      - focus: "Primary area of expertise"
      - principles: "3-7 specific behavioral principles"
      - style: "Communication and work style"
    
    quality-standards:
      - Principles must be specific and measurable
      - Style should be consistent with role
      - No overlap with other agents' personas
      - Focus on expertise, not tasks
    
    examples:
      good-principle: "Pragmatic over perfect - ship working code, refine later"
      bad-principle: "Write good code"  # Too vague
      
  command-requirements:
    naming-conventions:
      pattern: "verb-noun"
      examples:
        - "review-implementation"
        - "update-developer-guide"
        - "create-story"
      anti-examples:
        - "do-stuff"  # Too vague
        - "review"    # Missing noun
    
    mapping-rules:
      - Every command must map to a task file or template
      - Commands without mappings are invalid
      - Command names must be self-documenting
    
    documentation:
      - Brief description of what command does
      - Parameters and their types
      - Expected outcomes
      - Example usage
      
  handoff-contract-requirements:
    structure:
      input:
        - description: "What data/files this agent receives"
        - schema: "Expected format/structure"
        - source: "Which agent(s) provide this input"
      
      output:
        - description: "What data/files this agent produces"
        - schema: "Output format/structure"
        - location: "Where output is stored"
      
      next-agents:
        - agent-id: "Identifier of next agent"
        - input: "What from output they receive"
        - trigger: "Condition for handoff (auto, if-passed, if-failed, manual)"
    
    validation-rules:
      - Input schema must match previous agent's output
      - All next-agents must be valid agent-ids
      - Circular dependencies must be intentional (not bugs)
      - Trigger conditions must be boolean-decidable
    
    examples:
      valid-handoff:
        next-agents:
          - agent: "tech-lead"
            input: "story-file"
            trigger: "auto"
          - agent: "developer"  
            input: "review-results"
            trigger: "if-failed"
      
      invalid-handoff:
        next-agents:
          - agent: "someone"  # Non-existent agent
            input: "stuff"     # Vague input
            trigger: "maybe"   # Non-decidable trigger

    loading-strategy:
      - Global dependencies: Listed in agent definition
      - Project dependencies: Loaded from .agentrc.yaml
      - Lazy loading: Load only when needed
      - Cache: Avoid reloading same dependencies
    
    path-resolution:
      - "{project}" token replaced with path from .agentrc.yaml
      - Relative paths resolved from project root
      - Absolute paths used as-is

  detection-patterns:
    overlapping-responsibilities:
      symptoms:
        - Two agents provide similar feedback
        - Same files modified by multiple agents
        - Parallel agents contradict each other
      diagnosis:
        - Compare agent personas for overlap
        - Review handoff contracts for ambiguity
        - Check command definitions for duplication
    
    ambiguous-handoffs:
      symptoms:
        - Agents unsure when to trigger next agent
        - Data format mismatches in handoffs
        - Missing expected inputs
      diagnosis:
        - Validate handoff contract schemas
        - Check trigger condition clarity
        - Verify output format consistency
    
    circular-dependencies:
      symptoms:

        - No clear termination condition
      diagnosis:
        - Map workflow DAG
        - Identify cycles
        - Determine if intentional (e.g., test-fix loop)
