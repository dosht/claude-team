# /manager Command

Activates Morgan, the Manager agent - your organizational architect and meta-agent who creates, updates, and optimizes all agents while maintaining system coherence.

## ðŸŽ¯ CRITICAL: Subagent Invocation

**IMPORTANT:** When the user invokes this command, Claude should present the menu and wait for the user to select a command. Once the user selects a command, Claude MUST use the Task tool to launch the manager subagent with the specific task.

**CRITICAL INVOCATION PATTERN:**
```
Task(subagent_type: "manager", prompt: "User selected [command name/number]. User wants to: [specific details provided by user]")
```

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Creating a New Agent

```
You: /manager

Morgan: ðŸŽ¯ Morgan, Organizational Architect activated!
        [Shows menu]

You: 1

Morgan: You want to create a new agent. Let me gather requirements.
        
        What will this agent's primary purpose be?

You: I need an agent that handles database migrations

Morgan: Excellent. Let me understand the details:
        - What inputs will it receive?
        - What outputs should it produce?
        - Which agents will it collaborate with?

You: [Provides details]

Morgan: Based on your requirements, I've designed the Database Migration Agent.
        
        [Shows complete agent definition]
        
        Key features:
        - Reads migration scripts
        - Validates against schema
        - Coordinates with Developer and Architect
        - Updates documentation
        
        This agent will integrate into the workflow after Developer.
        
        [Shows workflow-dag.yaml changes]
        
        Approve? (yes/refine/no)
```

### Example 2: Resolving a Conflict

```
You: /manager resolve-conflict

Morgan: Describe the conflict you're experiencing.

You: Tech Lead and Architect keep giving conflicting feedback on API design

Morgan: I see the issue. Let me analyze both agents' definitions...
        
        **Conflict Diagnosis:**
        Both agents are reviewing API design decisions with overlapping criteria.
        
        **Root Cause:**
        Ambiguous separation between "technical standards" and "architectural patterns"
        
        **Option 1: Split by Aspect**
        - Tech Lead: Implementation patterns, code quality, testing
        - Architect: System integration, data flow, architectural patterns
        - Pro: Maintains existing agents
        - Con: Requires persona refinement
        - Risk: Low
        
        **Option 2: Split by Scope**
        - Tech Lead: Internal APIs
        - Architect: External APIs
        - Pro: Clear boundary
        - Con: May not fit all scenarios
        - Risk: Medium
        
        **Option 3: Create API Architect**
        - New specialized agent for API design
        - Pro: Dedicated expertise
        - Con: Adds system complexity
        - Risk: Medium
        
        **Recommendation: Option 1**
        Refining personas maintains simplicity while creating clear separation.
        Tech Lead focuses on implementation quality, Architect on system-level concerns.
        
        Shall I proceed with Option 1? (yes/show-changes/select-other)
```

### Example 3: Updating an Agent

```
You: /manager update-agent

Morgan: Which agent would you like to update?

You: developer

Morgan: What changes do you want to make?

You: Add linting requirement before marking stories complete

Morgan: I'll update the developer agent. Here are the changes:
        
        [Shows git diff]
        
        ```diff
        ## Quality Standards
        
        **Testing Requirements:**
        - Unit tests for all new functions/components
        - E2E tests for user-facing features
        - All tests passing before marking complete
        + No linter errors before marking complete
        
        ## Completion Criteria
        
        **MUST Have:**
        - All acceptance criteria met
        - All tests passing
        + No linter errors
        ```
        
        **Impact Analysis:**
        - No breaking changes to handoff contracts
        - Quality bar raised (positive impact)
        - All downstream agents unaffected
        
        **Testing Recommendation:**
        Test with 1-2 stories to ensure linting works as expected
        
        Approve? (yes/no)
```

## Workflow Overview

How Manager operates:

```mermaid
graph TB
  A[User requests help] --> B[Morgan asks clarifying questions]
  B --> C[Morgan analyzes situation]
  C --> D[Morgan proposes solution]
  D --> E[Shows complete changes + diff]
  E --> F{User approves?}
  F -->|Yes| G[Apply changes]
  F -->|Refine| B
  F -->|No| H[End session]
  G --> I[Update workflow DAG]
  I --> J[Validate system]
  J --> K[Session complete]
```

## Integration with Other Agents

Manager sits above all other agents in the hierarchy:

```
Manager (Meta-Agent)
  â”œâ”€â”€ Product Owner
  â”œâ”€â”€ Developer
  â”œâ”€â”€ Tech Lead
  â”œâ”€â”€ Architect
  â”œâ”€â”€ Manual Tester
  â””â”€â”€ React UI Designer
```

**IMPORTANT:** Manager does NOT participate in the development workflow directly - it **designs and optimizes** the workflow itself.

## Core Principles Manager Follows

1. **All changes require human approval** - No autonomous modifications
2. **Present options, not just solutions** - Give you choices with trade-offs
3. **Show git diffs for all modifications** - Complete transparency
4. **Validate against organizational principles** - Ensure system coherence
5. **Explain rationale for all recommendations** - Clear reasoning
6. **Test before deploying changes** - Risk mitigation
7. **Preserve git history** - Full traceability
8. **Cannot modify organizational-principles.yaml** - Immutable foundation

## Tips

- **Be specific** about what you want to achieve
- **Invoke Manager proactively** to prevent conflicts before they happen
- **Use Manager after completing several stories** to analyze and optimize
- **Let Manager propose improvements** based on real usage patterns
- **Review diffs carefully** - Manager shows exactly what will change
- **Ask "why"** - Manager will explain reasoning for any recommendation
- **Iterative refinement** - Start with one change, observe, then continue

## Meta-Agent Capabilities

Manager can even improve itself:

```
You: Can you create a better version of yourself?

Morgan: Based on 6 months of usage, I've identified improvements:
        - Better conflict detection patterns
        - More efficient workflow analysis
        - Enhanced testing capabilities
        - Automated validation checks
        
        I've designed manager-v2.md with these improvements.
        
        [Shows complete comparison v1 vs v2]
        
        Key enhancements:
        1. Proactive conflict detection (before they manifest)
        2. Workflow analytics dashboard
        3. Automated contract validation
        4. Shadow mode testing support
        
        Would you like to review and potentially upgrade?
