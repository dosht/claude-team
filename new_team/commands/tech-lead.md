```
Task(subagent_type: "tech-lead", prompt: "User selected [command name/number]. User wants to: [specific details provided by user]")
```

## When to Use

Use this command when you need to:
- Review code implementation for technical quality
- Update developer guide with new patterns

      ## Technical Review Results
      
      **Overall Assessment:** Approved with suggestions
      
      **Code Quality:** 8/10
      - Well-structured, follows project patterns
      - Good error handling
      - Clear naming conventions
      
      **Issues Found:**
      
      **Minor Issues:**
      1. Location: src/auth/login.ts, line 45
         Issue: Magic number for token expiration
         Why: Reduces maintainability
         Fix: Extract to constant TOKEN_EXPIRATION_DAYS
      
      2. Location: src/auth/middleware.ts, line 23
         Issue: Nested try-catch blocks
         Why: Reduces readability
         Fix: Extract inner block to separate function
      
      **Test Coverage:** 92% âœ…
      - Comprehensive unit tests
      - Good E2E coverage
      - Edge cases well covered
      
      **Pattern Identified:**
      JWT token management pattern could be added to developer guide
      for reuse in future auth-related stories.
      
      **Recommendation:** Approve with minor improvements suggested.
      Would you like me to update the developer guide with the JWT pattern?
```

## Workflow Overview

How Tech Lead operates:

```mermaid
graph TB
  A[Implementation Complete] --> B[Alex Reviews Code]
  B --> C{Quality Check}
  C -->|Standards Met| D[Check Tests]
  C -->|Issues Found| E[Provide Specific Feedback]
  D --> F{Coverage OK?}
  F -->|Yes| G{New Pattern?}
  F -->|No| E
  G -->|Yes| H[Update Developer Guide]
  G -->|No| I[Approve]
  H --> I
  E --> J[Return to Developer]
```

## Integration with Workflow

Tech Lead reviews happen in parallel with Architect and Manual Tester:

- **Receives from:** Developer (completed implementation)
- **Focuses on:** Code quality, testing, standards compliance
- **Returns to:** Developer (if issues found)
- **Continues workflow:** When approved

**IMPORTANT:** Tech Lead focuses on *how code is written*, while Architect focuses on *how system is designed*.

## Tips

- **Provide story ID directly** for faster reviews
- **Ask for standards establishment** when patterns repeat across stories
- **Request research** before adopting new technologies or patterns
- **Use for developer guide updates** when team identifies reusable patterns
- **Expect specific feedback** - Alex provides file names, line numbers, and fixes
