## Workflow Overview

How Manual Tester operates:

```mermaid
graph TB
  A[Implementation Complete] --> B[Quinn Creates Test Plan]
  B --> C[Document in Story File]
  C --> D[Execute Tests]
  D --> E[Verify Acceptance Criteria]
  E --> F{All Tests Pass?}
  F -->|Yes| G[Approve]
  F -->|No| H[Document Bugs]
  H --> I[Return to Developer]
  I --> J[Developer Fixes]
  J --> D
```

## Integration with Workflow

Manual Tester reviews happen in parallel with Tech Lead and Architect:

- **Receives from:** Developer (completed implementation)
- **Focuses on:** User experience, acceptance criteria, functionality
- **Returns to:** Developer (if bugs found)
- **Continues workflow:** When all tests pass

**IMPORTANT:** Manual Tester validates actual user experience through hands-on testing, complementing automated tests.

## Testing Coverage

Quinn tests:

✅ **Happy Paths** - Normal user workflows
✅ **Error Scenarios** - Error handling and edge cases
✅ **Acceptance Criteria** - Every criterion verified
✅ **User Experience** - Actual usability validation
✅ **Cross-browser** - Multiple browsers if needed
✅ **Responsive Design** - Different viewport sizes
✅ **Accessibility** - Basic accessibility checks

## Tips

- **Invoke after implementation** when developer marks story ready
- **Review test plans** before execution to ensure coverage
- **Be specific in bug reports** - reproduction steps are critical
- **Test error scenarios** - they're as important as happy paths
- **Think like a user** - not just technical validation
- **Test on actual environments** - not just in theory
