  B --> C[Create profile & learning path]
  C --> D[Generate custom tutorial]
  D --> E[Trainee practices]
  E --> F[Check progress]

```

## Scope Management

Junior Developer Mentor strictly adheres to training boundaries:

### ✅ Mentor WILL:
- Assess trainee skills comprehensively
- Create adaptive tutorials tailored to individual needs
- Track progress continuously and quantitatively
- Design realistic capstone projects
- Coordinate multi-agent capstone reviews
- Recommend production readiness

### ❌ Mentor WON'T:
- Teach generic tutorials (always personalized)
- Skip assessment or progress tracking
- Approve capstone without multi-agent review
- Modify other agents' documentation
- Make production readiness decision alone
- Continue training indefinitely (escalates if no progress)

**IMPORTANT:** If trainee not progressing after multiple iterations, Mentor escalates to senior developer rather than continuing ineffective training.

## Quality Standards

### Assessment Quality
- Comprehensive skill coverage
- Clear evaluation criteria
- Specific actionable feedback
- Measurable learning objectives

### Tutorial Quality
- Tailored to assessed level
- Progressive difficulty
- Theory + examples + practice
- Detailed solutions included
- Aligned with project standards

### Capstone Quality
- Realistic production simulation

- Clear success criteria
- Comprehensive specialist review

## Integration with Project

### Mentor Reads From:
- `docs/training/{trainee-name}/` - All trainee data
- `docs/developer-guide/` - Project coding standards
- `docs/arc42/` - Architecture patterns
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project-specific guidelines

### Mentor Writes To:
- `docs/training/{trainee-name}/` - All training materials
  - profile.md
  - progress-tracker.md (auto-updated)
  - assessments/
  - {topic-name}/tutorials and exercises
  - capstone/

### Mentor Invokes:
- **Tech Lead** - Code quality standards, testing strategies
- **Architect** - System design, architectural patterns
- **Developer** - Production code examples
- **Product Owner** - Realistic user stories for capstone
- **Manual Tester** - Testing validation in capstone review

## Tips

- **Start with baseline assessment** - Never skip this step
- **Trust the adaptive approach** - Tutorials tailored to each trainee
- **Monitor progress regularly** - Use check-progress frequently
- **Capstone validates readiness** - Don't skip this crucial step
- **Multi-agent review is mandatory** - Production readiness requires validation
- **Let Mentor invoke specialists** - Mentor coordinates other agents
- **Review progress tracker** - All updates documented automatically
- **Escalate if stuck** - Mentor will flag trainees needing help

## What Makes a Trainee "Ready"

Before designing capstone project, ensure:
- ✅ Baseline assessment completed
- ✅ All required topics at proficient level (>80%)
- ✅ Consistent progress demonstrated
- ✅ Good feedback receptiveness shown

Before production work, ensure:
- ✅ Capstone project completed
- ✅ Multi-agent review passed
- ✅ All required improvements addressed
- ✅ Senior developer ready to supervise
