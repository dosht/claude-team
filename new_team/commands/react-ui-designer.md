         size: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large';
         disabled?: boolean;
         loading?: boolean;
         onClick: () => void;
         children: React.ReactNode;
         icon?: React.ReactNode;
         fullWidth?: boolean;
       }
       ```
       
       ### States Designed
       ‚úÖ Default state
       ‚úÖ Hover state
       ‚úÖ Active/pressed state
       ‚úÖ Focus state (keyboard navigation)

       ‚úÖ Loading state (with spinner)
       
       ### Accessibility Features
       ‚úÖ Semantic <button> element
       ‚úÖ ARIA labels for loading state
       ‚úÖ Keyboard navigation support
       ‚úÖ Focus indicators
       ‚úÖ Color contrast WCAG AA compliant
       ‚úÖ Touch-friendly size (44px minimum)
       
       ### Responsive Design

       ‚úÖ Appropriate sizing on all viewports
       ‚úÖ fullWidth option for mobile layouts
       
       ### Visual Design

       - Secondary: Subtle, outline style
       - Danger: Red, for destructive actions
       - Smooth transitions on interactions
       - Loading spinner matches button color

```

### Example: Reviewing UI

```
You: /react-ui-designer review-ui

Riley: Which component would you like me to review?

You: src/components/LoginForm.tsx

Riley: Loading LoginForm component...
       
       ## UI Review Results
       
       **Component:** LoginForm.tsx
       **Overall Score:** 6/10 - Improvements needed
       
       ### Accessibility: ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Found
       
       **Critical Issues:**
       1. Missing ARIA labels on input fields
          - Fix: Add aria-label or associate with <label> elements
       
       2. No keyboard navigation for password toggle
          - Fix: Make toggle button keyboard accessible
       
       **Minor Issues:**
       3. Color contrast on error text: 3.2:1 (needs 4.5:1)
          - Fix: Use darker red (#C41E3A instead of #FF6B6B)
       
       ### Responsive Design: ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Found
       
       **Issues:**
       1. Form breaks on viewport < 360px
          - Fix: Adjust padding and font sizes for small screens
       
       2. Submit button too small on mobile
          - Fix: Increase height to 48px minimum for touch targets
       
       ### UX Patterns: ‚ùå Missing
       
       **Critical:**
       1. No loading state during submission
          - Fix: Add loading spinner, disable form during submit
       
       2. No error state handling
          - Fix: Display error messages from API failures
       
       3. Password field doesn't toggle visibility
          - Fix: Add show/hide password button
       
       ### Visual Consistency: ‚úÖ Good
       - Colors match design system
       - Typography consistent
       - Spacing follows 8px grid
       
       ### Performance: ‚úÖ Good
       - No unnecessary re-renders
       - Proper form optimization
       
       **Recommendation:** Changes required before production.
       Critical accessibility and UX issues must be addressed.

## Workflow Overview

How React UI Designer operates:

```mermaid
graph TB
  A[Design Request] --> B[Riley Analyzes Requirements]
  B --> C[Design Component Structure]
  C --> D[Design All States]
  D --> E[Add Accessibility]
  E --> F[Ensure Responsive]
  F --> G[Implement Component]
  G --> H[Document Usage]
  H --> I[Component Ready]
```

## Design Principles

Riley follows these principles:

‚ú® **Beauty + Functionality** - Good design is both
‚ôø **Accessibility First** - WCAG 2.1 Level AA minimum
üì± **Mobile-First** - Start small, scale up
üîß **Component Reusability** - Build once, use everywhere
üé® **Consistent Design Language** - Same patterns throughout
‚ö° **Immediate Feedback** - Users never wonder what's happening
üéØ **Design All States** - Loading, error, empty, success
‚öõÔ∏è **Modern React** - Hooks, composition, performance

## Component Checklist

Every component Riley designs includes:

‚úÖ **All States:**
- Default, hover, active, focus, disabled, loading, error, empty, success

‚úÖ **Accessibility:**
- Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support

‚úÖ **Responsive:**
- Mobile, tablet, desktop - all tested

‚úÖ **Documentation:**
- Props API, usage examples, accessibility notes

## Tips

- **Be specific** about component requirements and constraints
- **Request design system** for consistency across multiple components
- **Ask for reviews** to catch accessibility and UX issues early
- **Provide context** about where component will be used
- **Think about states** - loading, error, empty states matter
- **Consider mobile** - Riley designs mobile-first by default
